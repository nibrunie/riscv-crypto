Description::
A GHASH~H~ multiply is performed.

The multipliers are read as 4-element groups from 'vd',
 the multiplicands subkeys are read from either the corresponding 4-element group
in `vs2` (vector-vector form) or the scalar element group in `vs2`
(vector-scalar form, `Zvkgb` only). The resulting products are written as 4-element groups into `vd`.

This instruction treats all of the inputs and outputs as 128-bit polynomials and 
performs operations over GF[2].
It produces the product over GF(2^128^) of the two 128-bit inputs.

The multiplication over GF(2^128^) is a carryless multiply of two 128-bit polynomials
modulo GHASH's irreducible polynomial (x^128^ + x^7^ + x^2^ + x + 1).

The NIST specification (see <<zvkg>>) orders the coefficients from left to right x~0~x~1~x~2~...x~127~
for a polynomial x~0~ + x~1~u +x~2~ u^2^ + ... + x~127~u^127^. This can be viewed as a collection of
byte elements in memory with the byte containing the lowest coefficients (i.e., 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
residing at the lowest memory address. Since the bits in the bytes are reversed, 
This instruction internally performs bit swaps within bytes to put the bits in the standard ordering
(e.g., 7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0).

This instruction must always be implemented such that its execution latency does not depend
on the data being operated upon.

[NOTE]
====
We are bit-reversing the bytes of inputs and outputs so that the intermediate values are consistent
with the NIST specification. These reversals are inexpensive to implement as they unconditionally
swap bit positions and therefore do not require any logic.
====


[NOTE]
====
The instruction `vgmul.vv` is identical to `vghsh.vv` with vs1=0.
This instruction is often used in GHASH code. In some cases it is followed
by an XOR to perform a multiply-add. Implementations may choose to fuse these
two instructions to improve performance on GHASH code that
doesn't use the add-multiply form of the `vghsh.vv` instruction.

Similarly, the instruction `vgmul.vs` is identical to `vghsh.vs` with vs1=0.

Operation::
[source,pseudocode]
--
function clause execute (VGMUL(vs2, vs1, vd, suffix)) = {
  // operands are input with bits reversed in each byte
  if(LMUL*VLEN < EGW)  then {
    handle_illegal();  // illegal instruction exception
    RETIRE_FAIL
  } else {

  eg_len = (vl/EGS)
  eg_start = (vstart/EGS)

  foreach (i from eg_start to eg_len-1) {
    let helem = if suffix == "vv" then i else 0;
    let Y = brev8(get_velem(vd,EGW=128,i));  // Multiplier
    let H = brev8(get_velem(vs2,EGW=128, helem)); // Multiplicand
    let Z : bits(128) = 0;

    for (int bit = 0; bit < 128; bit++) {
      if bit_to_bool(Y[bit])
        Z ^= H

      bool reduce = bit_to_bool(H[127]);
      H = H << 1; // left shift H by 1
      if (reduce)
        H ^= 0x87; // Reduce using x^7 + x^2 + x^1 + 1 polynomial
    }


    let result = brev8(Z);
    set_velem(vd, EGW=128, i, result);
  }
  RETIRE_SUCCESS
