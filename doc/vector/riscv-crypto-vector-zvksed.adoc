=== `Zvksed` - ShangMi Suite: SM4 Block Cipher Instructions

Instructions for accelerating single round 
encryption, decryption and key-schedule
functions of the SM4 block cipher.

All of these instructions work on 128-bit elements, and hence
require that `Zvl128b` or greater must be supported on
the host system. That is, `VLEN>=128`.
Systems which do not meet these requirements cannot support the <<zvksed>>
extension.

Systems which implement `VLEN<128` should consider the existing
Scalar Cryptography Extensions, specifically <<Zkne,Zkne>> and <<Zknd,Zknd>>
for accelerated cryptographic operations.
