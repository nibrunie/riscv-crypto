NOTE::
- We are currently defining two variations of Zvknh: Zvknha for SHA-256 only, and Zvknhb for SHA-256 and SHA-512
- Question: Is this the best way to do this?


For SHA-256, implementations with VLEN < 128 require software to use LMUL>1 to combine
elements from register groups to provide all four elements of the element group.

For SHA-512, implementations with VLEN < 256 require software to use LMUL>1 to combine
elements from register groups to provide all four elements of the element group.

// Systems which do not meet these requirements cannot support the <<zvknha>>
// extension.

// It is _possible_ to formulate these instructions such that they work
// on systems with a narrower `VLEN` (i.e 32 or 64) and use `LMUL=2,4` to
// create inputs which are large enough to contain enough information.
// However, this incurs a large amount of complexity in the instructions
// design and implementation.

Systems which implement `VLEN<128` should consider the existing
Scalar Cryptography Extensions, specifically <<Zkne,Zkne>> and <<Zknd,Zknd>>
for accelerated cryptographic operations.
