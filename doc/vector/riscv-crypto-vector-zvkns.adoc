=== `Zvkns` - NIST Suite: Vector AES Encryption & Decryption (Single Round)

Instructions for accelerating single round 
encryption, decryption and key-schedule
functions of the AES block cipher.

All of these instructions work on 128-bit element groups.
For the best performance, it is suggested that they be implemented on systems with `VLEN`>=128.
On systems with `VLEN`<128, element groups may be formed by concatenating 32-bit elements (or element
groups of 32-bit elements) from registers within a register group.  
// Systems which do not meet these requirements cannot support the <<zvkns>> extension.

// It is _possible_ to formulate these instructions such that they work
// on systems with a narrower `VLEN` (i.e 32 or 64) and use `LMUL=2,4` to
// create inputs which are large enough to contain enough information.
// However, this incurs a large amount of complexity in the instructions
// design and implementation.

Systems which implement `VLEN<128` should consider the existing
Scalar Cryptography Extensions, specifically <<Zkne,Zkne>> and <<Zknd,Zknd>>
for accelerated cryptographic operations.
