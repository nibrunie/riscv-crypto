Description:: 
Performs 2 rounds of SM3 Compression, producing eight 32-bit outputs in
a 256-bit 8-element group.

The immediate field `rnd` has only two valid values: 0 and 1; all other values are reserved.
A 'rnd' value of 0 is used for rounds 0-15, and 1 is used for rounds 16-63.

It treats each 256-bit 8-element group of `vd` as eight 32-bit words,  
and each 256-bit 8-element group of `vs2` as eight 32-bit words. Only 4 of these words are consumed by
this instruction, the rest are don't-cares.

vs1 = {w[j], w[j+1], w[j+2], w[j+3], w[j+4], w[j+5], w[j+6], w[j+7]}

The values consumed by the instruction are

vs1 = {w[j], w[j+1], -, -, w[j+4], w[j+5], -, -}

Where the "-" characters are not consumed and are therefore don't cares.

This instruction consumes the "W" message schedule inputs and internally generates the "W'" values as needed



// NB::
// It probably makes sense to have vs1 and vs2 hold eight 32-bit words each and have 4 versions of this instruction;
// one for each pair of inputs.
// This fits more naturally with the generating instructions and doesn't leave us with the oddity of 64-bit and 256-bit element groups
// Vd (in) = {A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H} 
// vs1 = W[0:7]  // 8 expanded words
// vs2 = Wâ€™[0:7] // 8 expanded words with XORing
// Vd (out) = {A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H} 




This instruction treats `EEW=32` regardless of `vtype.vsew`
`vl` needs to be set to eight times the number of element groups.
If vstart is not zero, it needs to be scaled similarly.
This instruction requires that `Zvl128b` be implemented (i.e `VLEN>=128`).
