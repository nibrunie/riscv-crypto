Description:: 
This instruction performs a multiply between two 128-bit polynomials modulo the irreducible polynomial
x^128^ + x^7^ + x^2^ + x + 1

It treats each EGW=128 element group of `vs1` and `vs2` as the input polynomials.
This instruction is intended to be used to implement a GHASH~H~ as defined in NIST Special Publication 800-38D
"Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation:
Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and GMAC". See
link:https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-38d/final[here]
This specification orders the coefficients in increasing order from left to right x~0~x~1~...x~127~
for a polynomial x~0~ + x~1~u +x~2~ u^2^ + ... + x~127~u^127^.

In order to match the GHASH specification, the bits within bytes are reversed internally to the instruction
so that the least significant bit is on the left.

// This instruction effectively applies a single 128x128 carryless multiply producing a 255-bit product which it reduces
// by multiplying the most significant 127 bits by the irreducible polynomial x^128^ + x^7^ + x^2^ + x + 1,
// and adding it to the least significant 128 bits,
// producing a 128-bit result which is written to the corresponding element group in `vd`.

- Element Group Width (EGW) = 128 bits
- Effective Element Width (EEW) = 32 bits
- Element Group Size (EGS) = 4 elements

This instruction ignores `vtype.vsew`. +
The number of element groups to be processed is `vl`/`EGS`.
`vl` must be set to the number of `EEW=32` elements to be processed and 
therefore must be a multiple of `EGS=4`. + 
Likewise, `vstart` must be a multiple of `EGS=4`

// It requires that `Zvl128b`be implemented (i.e `VLEN>=128`).
