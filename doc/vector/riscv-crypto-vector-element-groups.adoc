=== Crypto Vector Element Groups

Vector crypto instructions operate on larger operands than instructions in the base vector extension. Typically, these operands are 128- and 256-bits wide. In many cases, these operands are comprised of smaller elements that are combined. However, in other cases these operands are a single value. For example, AES operates on 128-bit blocks comprised of four 32-bit words using 128-bit round keys that are generated from 128-, 192, and 256-bit cipher keys.

In order to be compatible with the 32- and 64-bit element widths of the base vector instructions,
we treat these operands as a vector of one of more element groups (see 
link:https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/blob/master/element_groups.adoc[RISC-V Vector Element Groups]).

An element group is defined by three parameters, all of which are explicitly defined by each crypto instruction
that operates on them:

- Element Group Width (EGW) total number of bits in an element group
- Element Group Size (EGS) = Number of elements in an element group
- Effective Element Width (EEW) = number of bits in each element

When the EEW is explicitly defined for a vector crypto instruction, the current `SEW` is ignored by that instruction.

As with all vector instructions, the number of elements processed by a vector instruction is specified by the
vector length `vl`. The number of element groups operated upon is then `vl`/`EGS`. If this ratio is not an
integral value, an illegal instruction exception is raised.

Since `vstart` is expressed in elements, the starting element group is `vstart`/`EGS`. If this ratio is not an
integral value, an illegal instruction exception is raised.

The Vector Crypto instructions that operate on element groups each have a minimum `VLEN` that is equal
to the `EGW`. An attempt to execute an instruction with `VLEN`<`EGW` will cause an illegal
instruction exception to be raised. 

Systems which implement `VLEN<EGW` should consider the existing
Scalar Cryptography Extensions, specifically <<Zkne,Zkne>> and <<Zknd,Zknd>>
for accelerated cryptographic operations.
