=== Crypto Vector-Scalar Instructions

The RISC-V Vector Extension defines three forms of vector-scalar operations, based teh source of the scalar operand:

- A five-bit immediate
- A scalar _x_ register
- A scalar _f_ register

However, there are also Vector Reduction Operations where the scalar operand is provided by element 0 of
vector register _VS1_. The vector operand is provided in vector register group _VS2_.
These reduction operations all use the _.vs_ suffix in their mnemonics.

The reduction operations all produce a scalar result in element 0 of the destination register, _vd_.

For the vector crypto extensions, we are defining vector-scalar instruction that are similar to these
Vector Reduction Operations in that they they get a scalar operand from vector element group 0. 
(see link:https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/blob/master/element_groups.adoc[RISC-V Vector Element Groups])
However, they differ from the reduction operations in that they return vector results to Vd, which is also a
source vector operand. These vector-scalar crypto instructions will also use the _.vs_ suffix in their mnemonics.

We are defining these instructions for use where a single key, specified as a single element group, is to be
applied to each element group of a vector group of element groups. For example, it is common for multiple
AES encryption rounds to be performed in parallel with the same round key. Rather than having to first
splat the common key across the whole vector group, these vector-scalar vector crypto instructions allow the
round key to be specified as a scalar.

In the case of AES256 all rounds instructions we need to provide two 128-bit keys; one is held in `vs1` and
the other is held in `vs2`. The 128-bit data to be processed is held in `vd`.
A vector-scalar form of this instruction looks different from the existing vector-scalar instructions in that
both `vs1` and `vs2` are treated as scalar operands that apply to the vector operands of `vd`. 

Note::
Previously, the AES and SM4 instructions that performed rounds operations (including AES all-rounds instructions)
were defined to be destructive operations where the data source was provided in _vd_ and the key was provided in
_vs2_. With the advent of the new crypto vector-scalar instructions, we are changing these instructions
to use _vs1_ for the key and _vs2_ for the data.
In the case of vector-scalar instructions, the scalar key will be held in
element group 0 of _vs1_. This is done to remain consistent with the use of _vs1_ for the scalar element in
all of the existing vector-scalar operations as well as the vector reduction operations.
